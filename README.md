# forkwatcher
A fork bomb detection and user control module for Android

## Introduction
In computing, a fork bomb is a denial-of-service attack wherein a process continually replicates itself to deplete available system resources, causing resource starvation and slowing or crashing the system. -wikipedia

In this case, the fork bomb is an android app which executes the fork system call in an infinite loop.

The app which we used can be found here: https://github.com/reyammer/android-forkbomb
